## About the Module
### What is the module?
The DNN Video Course Module provides a way to create courses using videos that allow only the users in specific roles to view the course. The user can only watch videos that have been previously watched or the next unwatched video. The progress of each user is saved to allow the user to watch portions of the course and return to the site to continue watching at a later time. The progress of all the users can be reviewed by a site administrator. Once a user has completed their course, an email will be sent to the site administrator. 

### How it works
## Roles and Categories
This module leverages the built in functionality of DNN’s Security Categories and Security Roles. When a new category is created through the module, a new Role Group is created with a string of text (“CCV_”) prepended to the name. This allows the module to filter and show only Role Groups associated to the video course module. All Courses added to the Category will be a Security Role within that specific Role Group.

### User Progress
During installation of the module, a new hidden User Profile property is added to the User Profile. As a video has been marked as complete by reaching the end of the video (a listener for the Vimeo API is used) the user’s profile is updated with the id for that video.
